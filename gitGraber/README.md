# About gitGraber

**gitGraber is a tool developed in Python3 to monitor GitHub to search and find sensitive data in real time for different online services such as: Google, Amazon (AWS), Paypal, Github, Mailgun, Facebook, Twitter, Heroku, Stripe, Twilio...**

## How it works ?

It's important to understand that gitGraber is not designed to check history of repositories, many tools can already do that great. gitGraber was originally developed to monitor and parse last indexed files on GitHub. If gitGraber find something interesting, you will receive a notification on your Slack channel. You can also use it to have results directly on the command line.

In our experience, we are convinced that leaks do not come only from the organizations themselves, but also from service providers and employees, who do not necessarily have a "profile" indicating that they work for a particular organization.

Regex are supposed to be as accurate as possible. Sometimes, maybe you will have false-positive, feel free to contribute to improve recon and add new regex for pattern detection.

We prefer to reduce false positive instead of sending notification for every "standard" API keys which could found by gitGraber but irrelevant for your monitoring.

# F.A.Q

## Why I only see "Github query" and "Status code : 200" in output ?

_gitGraber display some things directly in the CLI: GitHub request, status code abuse detection (200 or 403)... and if you don't see something like `` [+] POSSIBLE FOO TOKEN FOUND`` its simply because gitGraber did not find secrets tokens for your defined keyword._

## About the error message "Abuse detection reached for token"

_This message appears when GitHub detects a large number of requests from your own GitHub token. Don't worry, gitGraber can handle this and it will try to use another token defined in the ``config.py`` file. Note: This is a temporary limit and you don't need to create another token._

## Do I will receive same tokens for same repository every time that I run gitGraber ?

_No, to avoid this, gitGraber stores all repository URLs in a file named `` rawGitUrls.txt``. If a repository has already been scanned by gitGraber and found an API key, you will not receive a notification._

## How do I set a blacklisted pattern for a specific token ? 

_You have to edit the tokens.py file and add the pattern as a list argument when initializing the token. FFor example, to add the pattern XXXX to the MAILCHIMP token, the line `` tokensList.append(Token('MAILCHIMP', '\W(?:[a-f0-9]{32}(-us[0-9]{1,2}))\W'))`` becomes `` tokensList.append(Token('MAILCHIMP', '\W(?:[a-f0-9]{32}(-us[0-9]{1,2}))\W', ['XXXX']))``._



## Usage

``````````
usage: gitGraber.py [-h] [-k KEYWORDSFILE] [-q QUERY] [-s] [-w WORDLIST]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help                              Show this help message and exit
  -k KEYWORDSFILE, --keyword KEYWORDSFILE Specify a keywords file (-k keywordsfile.txt)
  -q QUERY, --query QUERY                 Specify your github query (-q "apikey")
  -m, --monitor                           Enable monitoring of your search query by creating cron job [Every 30 mins]
  -d, --discord                           Enable discord notifications
  -s, --slack                             Enable slack notifications
  -tg, --telegram                         Enable telegram notifications
  -w WORDLIST, --wordlist WORDLIST        Create a wordlist that fills dynamically with discovered filenames on GitHub
``````````
For example, to search for a specific word in github in combination with each word of the file keywordsfile.txt and output it to Slack  :

``````````
python3 gitGraber.py -k keywordsfile.txt -q YOURWORD -s
``````````
It is possible to search for a specific domain name for example, but this has to be surrounded by double quotes :

``````````
python3 gitGraber.py -k keywordsfile.txt -q \"yahoo.com\" -s
``````````

If you want to build a custom wordlist based on the files found on Github to use it then with your favorite fuzzing tool, add argument ``-w`` :


``````````
python3 gitGraber.py -k keywordsfile.txt -q \"yahoo.com\" -s -w mysuperwordlist.txt
``````````

If you want to monitor your search query every 30 mins you can use the `-m` flag that tells gitGraber to create a cron job based on your query :

``````````
python3 gitGraber.py -k keywordsfile.txt -q \"yahoo.com\" -s -m
``````````
The above will search for secrets every 30 min on your search query & send you a slack notification whenever there are any hits.

## Dependencies

gitGraber needs some dependencies, to install them on your environment:

``pip3 install -r requirements.txt``

## Configuration

Before to start **gitGraber** you need to modify the configuration file ``config.py`` :

- Add your own Github tokens (_Personal access tokens_) : ``GITHUB_TOKENS = ['yourToken1Here','yourToken2Here']``
- Add your own Discord Webhook : ``DISCORD_WEBHOOKURL = 'https://discordapp.com/api/webhooks/7XXXX/XXXXXX'``
- Add your own Slack Webhook : ``SLACK_WEBHOOKURL = 'https://hooks.slack.com/services/TXXXX/BXXXX/XXXXXXX'``
- Add your own Telegram Config : ``TELEGRAM_CONFIG = {
    "token": "XXXXX:xXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
    "chat_id": -99999999
}``

## Wordlists & Resources

Some wordlists & regex have been created by us and some others are inspired from other repos/researchers :

## TODO

- [X] Add a false positive detection
- [ ] Add args to only output results (to hide status code and other things)
- [X] Send only one notification for double tokens (for services like Twilio)
- [ ] Filter to send notification only if commit date is > to date defined in args
- [X] Improve "commit date" notification to display something like "[+] Commit date (5 days ago)"
- [ ] Add args to output results in file
- [ ] Add multi threads
- [ ] Improve token cleaning output
- [X] Add a "combo check" module (for services like Twilio that require two tokens)
- [X] Add user and org names display in notifications
- [X] Add commit date
- [X] Manage rate limit
